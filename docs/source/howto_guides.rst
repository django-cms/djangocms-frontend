.. _how to add internal link targets outside of the cms:

**************************************************
 How to add internal link targets outside the CMS
**************************************************

By default the link/button component offers available CMS pages of the
selected language as internal links.

The developer may extend this setting to include other page-generating
Django models as well by adding the ``DJANGOCMS_FRONTEND_LINK_MODELS``
setting to the project's ``settings.py`` file.

.. py:attribute:: settings.DJANGOCMS_FRONTEND_LINK_MODELS

    ``DJANGOCMS_FRONTEND_LINK_MODELS`` contains a list
    of additional models that can be linked.

    Each model is specified within its own dict. The resulting drop-down
    list will contain objects grouped by their type. The order of the types
    in the list is defined by the order of their definition in this setting.

    The only required attribute for each model is ``class_path``, which must
    be the full python path to the model.

    Additional attributes are:

    ``type``:
       This is the name that will appear in the grouped dropdown menu. If
       not specified, the name of the class will be used E.g., "``Page``".

    ``filter``:
       You can specify additional filtering rules here. This must be
       specified as a dict but is converted directly into kwargs internally,
       so, ``{'published': True}`` becomes ``filter(published=True)`` for
       example.

    ``order_by``:
       Specify the ordering of any found objects exactly as you would in a
       queryset. If this is not provided, the objects will be ordered in the
       natural order of your model, if any.

    ``search``:
        Specifies which (text) field of the model should be searched when
        the user types a search string.

.. note::

   Each of the defined models must define a ``get_absolute_url()``
   method on its objects or the configuration will be rejected.

Example for a configuration that allows linking CMS pages plus two
different page types from two djangocms-blog apps called "Blog" and
"Content hub" (having the ``app_config_id`` 1 and 2, respectively):

.. code:: python

   DJANGOCMS_FRONTEND_LINK_MODELS = [
       {
           "type": _("Blog pages"),
           "class_path": "djangocms_blog.models.Post",
           "filter": {"publish": True, "app_config_id": 1},
            "search": "translations__title",
       },
       {
           "type": _("Content hub pages"),
           "class_path": "djangocms_blog.models.Post",
           "filter": {"publish": True, "app_config_id": 2},
            "search": "translations__title",
       },
   ]

Another example might be (taken from djangocms-styledlink
documentation):

.. code:: python

   DJANGOCMS_FRONTEND_LINK_MODELS = [
       {
           'type': 'Clients',
           'class_path': 'myapp.Client',
           'manager_method': 'published',
           'order_by': 'title'
       },
       {
           'type': 'Projects',
           'class_path': 'myapp.Project',
           'filter': { 'approved': True },
           'order_by': 'title',
       },
       {
           'type': 'Solutions',
           'class_path': 'myapp.Solution',
           'filter': { 'published': True },
           'order_by': 'name',
       }
   ]

The link/button plugin uses select2 to show all available link targets.
This allows you to search the page titles.

.. warning::

   If you have a huge number (> 1,000) of link target (i.e., pages or
   blog entries or whatever) the current implementation might slow down
   the editing process. In your ``settings`` file you can set
   ``DJANGOCMS_FRONTEND_MINIMUM_INPUT_LENGTH`` to a value greater than 1 and
   **djangocms-frontend** will wait until the user inputs at least this many
   characters before querying potential link targets.

    single: Extend plugins

********************************
 How to extend existing plugins
********************************

Existing plugins can be extended through two type of class mixins.
``djangocms-frontend`` looks for these mixins in two places:

#. In the theme module. Its name is specified by the setting
   ``DJANGOCMS_FRONTEND_THEME`` and defaults to ``djangocms_frontend``.
   For a theme app called ``theme`` and the bootstrap5 framework this
   would be ``theme.frontends.bootstrap5.py``.

#. In ``djangocms_frontend.contrib.*app*.frontends.*framework*.py``. For the
   alert app and the bootstrap5 framework this would be
   ``djangocms_frontend.contrib.alert.frontends.bootstrap5.py``.

Both mixins are included if they exist and all methods have to call the
super methods to ensure all form extensions and render functionalities
are processed.

The theme module is primarily thought to allow for third party
extensions in terms of functionality and/or design.

The framework module is primarily thought to allow for adaptation of
``djangocms-frontend`` to other css frameworks besides Bootstrap 5.

.. index::
    single: RenderMixins

RenderMixins
============

The render mixins are called "``*PluginName*RenderMixin``", e.g.
``AlertRenderMixin`` and are applied to the plugin class. This allows
for the redefinition of the ``CMSPlugin.render`` method, especially to
prepare the context for rendering.

Also it can add fields to the front end editing form by subclassing
``CMSPlugin.get_fieldsets``. This allows for extension or change of the
plugin's admin form. The admin form is used to edit or create a plugin.

.. index::
    single: FormMixins

FormMixins
==========

Form mixins are used to add fields to a plugin's admin form. These
fields are available to the render mixins and, of course, to the plugin
templates.

Form mixins are called "``*PluginName*FormMixin``", e.g. ``AlertFormMixin`` and are
applied to the editing form class. Form mixins are a subclass of
``entangled.EntangledModelFormMixin``.

    single: Create a theme
    single: Themes

Working example
===============

Let's say you wanted to extend the ``GridContainerPlugin`` to offer the
option for a background image, and say a blur effect. The way to do it
is to create a theme app. You are free to chose its name. For this example
we take it to be "theme". Please replace "theme" by your own theme's name.

First, create a directory structure like this:

.. code-block::

    theme
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── forms.py
    ├── frameworks
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── bootstrap5.py
    ├── static
    │   └── css
    │       └── background_image.css
    └── templates
        └── djangocms_frontend
            └── bootstrap5
                └── grid_container.html


All ``__init__.py`` files remain empty.

Next, you add some fields to the ``GridContainerForm`` (in
``theme/forms.py``):

.. code:: python

    from django import forms
    from django.db.models import ManyToOneRel
    from django.utils.translation import gettext as _
    from djangocms_frontend import settings
    from entangled.forms import EntangledModelFormMixin
    from filer.fields.image import AdminImageFormField, FilerImageField
    from filer.models import Image


    IMAGE_POSITIONING = (
        ("center center", _("Fully Centered")),
        ("left top", _("Top left")),
        ("center top", _("Top center")),
        ("right top", _("Top right")),
        ("left center", _("Center left")),
        ("right center", _("Center right")),
        ("left bottom", _("Bottom left")),
        ("center bottom", _("Bottom center")),
        ("right bottom", _("Bottom right")),
    )


    class GridContainerFormMixin(EntangledModelFormMixin):
        class Meta:
            entangled_fields = {
                "config": [
                    "container_image",
                    "image_position",
                    "container_blur",
                ]
            }

        container_image = AdminImageFormField(
            rel=ManyToOneRel(FilerImageField, Image, "id"),
            queryset=Image.objects.all(),
            to_field_name="id",
            label=_("Image"),
            required=False,
            help_text=_("If provided used as a cover for container."),
        )
        image_position = forms.ChoiceField(
            required=False,
            choices=settings.EMPTY_CHOICE + IMAGE_POSITIONING,
            initial="",
            label=_("Background image position"),
        )
        container_blur = forms.IntegerField(
            required=False,
            initial=0,
            min_value=0,
            max_value=10,
            help_text=_("Blur of container image (in px)."),
        )

.. warning::

    These form fields are mixed to the original form. Please make sure to
    avoid name collisions for the fields.

.. note::

    If you need to add many form mixins, consider turning ``forms.py`` into a
    package, i.e. create a directory ``forms`` and distribute the mixins over
    several files, e.g., ``forms/marketing_forms.py`` etc., and importing the
    all mixins relevant to **djangocms-frontend** into the directory's
    ``__init__.py``.

Rendering should be done with the Bootstrap 5 framework. Hence all rendering
mixins go into ``theme/bootstrap5.py``. Since we are extending the
``GridContainer`` plugin the appropriate mixin to define is
``GridContainerMixin``:

.. code:: python

    from django.utils.translation import gettext as _
    from djangocms_frontend.helpers import insert_fields


    class GridContainerRenderMixin:
        render_template = "djangocms_frontend/bootstrap5/grid_container.html"

        def get_fieldsets(self, request, obj=None):
            """Extend the fieldset of the plugin to contain the new fields
            defined in forms.py"""
            return insert_fields(
                super().get_fieldsets(request, obj),
                (
                    "container_image",
                    (
                        "image_position",
                        "container_blur",
                    ),
                ),
                block=None,  # Create a new fieldset (called block here)
                position=1,  # at position 1 (i.e. directly after the mail fieldset)
                blockname=_("Image"),  # and call the fieldset "Image"
            )

        def render(self, context, instance, placeholder):
            """Render should process the form fields and turn them into appropriate
            context items or add corresponding classes to the instance"""
            if getattr(instance, "container_image", None):
                instance.add_classes("imagecontainer")
                context["bg_color"] = (
                    f"bg-{instance.background_context}"
                    if getattr(instance, "background_context", False)
                    else ""
                )
            return super().render(context, instance, placeholder)

.. warning::

    Do not forget to call ``super()`` in both the ``get_fieldsets`` and the
    ``render`` method.


The ``render`` method provides required context data for the extended
functionality. In this case it adds ``imagecontainer`` to the list of
classes for the container, processes the background colors since it should
appear above the image (and not below), as well as blur.

The ``get_fieldsets`` method is used to make django CMS show the new
form fields in the plugin's edit modal (admin form, technically
speaking).

Then, a new template is needed (in
``theme/templates/djangocms_frontend/bootstrap5/grid_container.html``):

.. code::

    {% load cms_tags sekizai_tags static %}{% spaceless %}
      <{{ instance.tag_type }}{{ instance.get_attributes }}
      {% if instance.background_opacity and not instance.image %}
        {% if instance.container_blur %}
          backdrop-filter: blur({{ instance.container_blur }}px);
        {% endif %}"
      {% endif %}>
      {% if instance.image %}
        <div class="image"
          style="background-image: url('{{ instance.image.url }}');
                 background-position: {{ instance.image_position|default:'center center' }};
                 background-repeat: no-repeat;background-size: cover;
                 {% if instance.container_blur %}
                   filter: blur({{ instance.container_blur }}px);
                 {% endif %}">
        </div>
      {% elif instance.container_image %}
        <div class="image placeholder placeholder-wave"></div>
      {% endif %}
      {% if bg_color %}
        <div class="cover {{ bg_color }}"{% if instance.background_opacity %}
             style="opacity: {{ instance.background_opacity }}%"{% endif %}></div>
      {% endif %}
      {% if instance.container_image %}
        <div class="content">
      {% endif %}
        {% for plugin in instance.child_plugin_instances %}
          {% render_plugin plugin %}
        {% endfor %}
      {% if instance.container_image %}</div>{% endif %}
    </{{ instance.tag_type }}>{% endspaceless %}
    {# Only add if the css is not included in your site's global css #}
    {% addtoblock 'css' %}
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/background_image.css' %}">
    {% endaddtoblock %}


Finally, a set of css style complement the new template. The styles can either
be added to the css block in the template (if used scarcely and as done in
the above example) or directly to your project's css files.

The required styles are:

.. code::

    /* Image Container */

    div.imagecontainer {
        position: relative;
        min-height: 112px;
    }

    div.imagecontainer > div.cover,
    div.imagecontainer > div.image {
        position: absolute;
        left:0;
        right:0;
        top:0;
        bottom:0;
    }

    div.imagecontainer > div.content {
        position: relative;
    }


With these three additions, all grid container plugins will now have
additional fields to define background images to cover the container
area.

If the theme is taken out of the path djangocms-frontend will fall back
to its basic functionality, i.e. the background images will not be
shown. As long as plugins are not edited the background image
information will be preserved.

.. note::

    A few suggestions on extending **djangocms-frontend**:

    *   You may think of customizing bootstrap by including a folder ``sass`` in
        your theme app. For more see `Bootstrap 5 documentation on customizing
        <https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/customize/overview/>`_.

    *   If you need entirely new plugins, create a file ``cms_plugins.py`` and
        import ``CMSUIPlugin`` (import from ``djangocms_frontend.cms_plugins``)
        as base class for the plugins.

    *   Create ``models.py``
        file for the models (which need to be proxy models of ``FrontendUIItem``
        (import from ``djangocms_frontend.models``).

***************************
 How to create a theme app
***************************

``djangocms-frontend`` is designed to be "themable". A theme typically
will do one or more of the following:

-  Style the appearance using css
-  Extend standard plugins
-  Add custom plugins

******************************************************
 How to add the tab editing style to my other plugins
******************************************************

If you prefer the tabbed frontend editing style of **djangocms-frontend** you
can easily add it to your own plugins.

If you use the standard editing form, just add a line specifying the
``change_form_template`` to your plugin class:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyCoolPlugin(CMSPluginBase):
        ...
        change_form_template = "djangocms_frontend/admin/base.html"
        ...


If you already have your own ``change_form_template``, make sure it extends
``djangocms_frontend/admin/base.html``:

.. code-block::

    {% extends "djangocms_frontend/admin/base.html" %}
    {% block ...%}
        ...
    {% endblock %}

*************************************
 How to migrate other plugin packages
*************************************

The management command ``migrate`` converts any plugin from **djangocms_bootstrap4**
and **djangocms_styled_link** to **djangocms-frontend**.
This behaviour can be extended adding custom migratation modules to
the ``DJANGOCMS_FRONTEND_ADDITIONAL_MIGRATIONS`` setting.

A migration module must contain this three objects:

plugin_migrations
    Dictionary with the configuration of migration process for
    each plugin class.

data_migration
    Dictionary with methods to transform attributes of the plugins.

plugin_prefix
    String with the prefix of the plugin_types that are being migrated.
    The migration process alerts if there are remaining plugins with
    this prefix.

Check the source code of ``management/bootstrap4_migration.py`` to get
more details about this three objects.
